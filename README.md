# Micheal Angelo

This site is my GitHub Pages hub — a central index of what I am currently building,
learning, and documenting through hands-on practice and public notes.

My focus is on developing strong technical fundamentals through consistent problem-solving,
structured learning, and open documentation of my progress.

---

## Current Focus

- Building core problem-solving ability through **daily LeetCode practice**
- Learning and documenting **AWS fundamentals** with the goal of contributing to the AWS community
- Actively working toward eligibility for the **AWS Community Builders Program**
- Participating in **Hackonomics 2026**, focusing on applied problem-solving and collaboration

## Projects & Active Work

### 🔹 AWS Learning Notes
Beginner-friendly notes documenting my understanding of AWS core services and concepts
as I learn through AWS Skill Builder and official documentation.

Topics include IAM, EC2, S3, and cloud fundamentals.

## Learning Philosophy

Progress is built through consistency rather than intensity.

Small, honest contributions — made public — compound over time,
until learning and doing become indistinguishable.

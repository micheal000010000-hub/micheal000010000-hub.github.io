This site documents my AWS learning journey, projects, and related technical notes.

My focus is on developing strong AWS fundamentals through hands-on practice,
public documentation, and continuous learning. This page is also part of my preparation
toward the **AWS Community Builders Program**.

## Current AWS Focus

- Learning and documenting **AWS fundamentals** through Skill Builder and hands-on labs  
- Core services: IAM, EC2, S3, and cloud essentials  
- Actively working toward eligibility for the **AWS Community Builders Program**  
- Preparing beginner-friendly notes and tutorials to share publicly

## Learning Philosophy

Progress is built through consistency rather than intensity.  
Small, honest contributions — made public — compound over time, until learning and doing become indistinguishable.

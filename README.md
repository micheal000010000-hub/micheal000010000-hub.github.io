# Micheal Angelo

This site is my GitHub Pages hub — a central index of what I’m currently working on and documenting on GitHub.

I focus on building strong technical fundamentals through **daily LeetCode problem-solving** and by maintaining **technical notes** that capture practical insights, non-obvious details, and clarifications encountered during ongoing development and study.

## Current Focus

- Solving LeetCode problems daily to strengthen problem-solving fundamentals  
- Writing and maintaining technical notes across tools, concepts, and industry observations  
- Learning system-level thinking through consistent, incremental work

## Learning Philosophy

Progress often comes from small, consistent contributions —  
where effort and outcome gradually become difficult to separate.

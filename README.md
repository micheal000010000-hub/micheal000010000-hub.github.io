> Garlapati Tarun — aka **Micheal Angelo**

This site documents my AWS learning journey, hands-on applications, and technical notes.
I write and publish my work under the name **Micheal Angelo**.

My primary focus is building practical AWS-based applications by working directly
from official documentation and validating concepts through implementation.
This page also represents part of my long-term preparation toward the
**AWS Community Builders Program**.

## Current AWS Focus

- Building **real-world applications** using AWS services rather than isolated demos  
- Designing and iterating on projects by closely following **official AWS documentation**  
  🔗 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/  
- Core services in active use: **IAM, EC2, S3**, and cloud fundamentals  
- Learning through implementation, testing, and documentation-driven exploration  
- Publishing clear, beginner-friendly explanations derived from hands-on work  
- Actively progressing toward eligibility for the **AWS Community Builders Program**

## Blogs & Writing

I regularly write about AWS concepts, implementation details, and learning takeaways.

## Learning Philosophy

Progress is built through **consistency, not intensity**.  
Small, honest contributions—made public—compound over time, until learning and doing
become indistinguishable.
